# Online Store

[Open project's website](https://production.d2e8slzocp32h5.amplifyapp.com/)

This project was created from scratch during Angular development course from online school Foxminded. The code is written only by me and checked by my mentor who is a profesional Angular developer with 7 years of work experience.

## What I learned and implemented in my project:

1. Components
2. Services
3. Pipes and custom pipes
4. Directives 
5. Work with Observables, Promises and RxJs operators
6. API for work with AWS DynamoDB (remote database)
7. Authorization service with additional option to use Google Account
8. Navigation and AuthGuard
9. Work with cookies
10. Reactive forms and custom validation
11. Angular material forms and custom form field component with input
12. CMS to add, edit and delete products

P.S. Some features on website are in present only visually, for example authorization using Facebook account, scaling image on product details page and adding reviews. I won't implement them in the near future since I am starting a new project for my portfolio.
